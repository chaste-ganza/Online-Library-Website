Hey, this is a note to give you a notion about this repository
Our WebUser interface teacher gave us an assignment to make a website and apply most of the things we've learned in WUI
So, I decided to make an online library for books
It is just a mock, it doesn't have proper backend, authentication system and database with books and other info
It was just created to apply skills of html, css and DOM js I've learned past the first semester at Rwanda Coding Academy
